## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About me ðŸ˜„
I'm Robert (he/him), a software developer based in MontrÃ©al.

I'm always looking for new things to learn and play around with, but my current interests include functional programming, distributed systems & developer tooling.

### What I've been up to ðŸ”­
I've most recently been playing around with [Gleam](https://gleam.run), working on things like:
- [glint](https://github.com/TanklesXL/glint): a `Gleam` library for building command-line applications.
- [gladvent](https://github.com/TanklesXL/gladvent): an Advent of Code runner for Gleam code that targets `erlang` (for running tasks concurrently) and leverages `glint` to build the CLI.
- [tastings](https://github.com/TanklesXL/tastings): a spirits tasting aide that scrapes masterofmalt.com and displays relevant sensory info.
